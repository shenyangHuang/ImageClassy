To Run Fully Connected Feedforward Neural Network 
you need to:
1. put "train_x.csv" and "train_y.csv" into a folder called "data" in this directory
2. Run the code!

Note: as mentioned in the report, using 200 neurons per layer and 4 hidden layers takes very long to train (>20 hours)
this code is not optimized for GPUs
